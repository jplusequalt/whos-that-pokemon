# WHO'S THAT POKEMON?

This is a fun little project I threw together after becoming addicted to Wordle, Heardle, and other riffs on the same idea. Ultimately, it ended up becoming a kind of Pokemon Red/Green inspired retro thing.

# HOW TO WORK

Clone the project, run `npm install` in the frontend, and then `npm start` in both folders to host it locally. Enjoy!

# Still a work in progress
Some of the features aren't fully implemented yet.
